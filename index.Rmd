I am a current student at Grand Valley State University, majoring in Statistics with a minor in Economics. On top of this, I am also in a Student Initiated Combined Degree Program which means I am also taking classes to acquire a Masters degree in Applied Statistics.  
  
This work has given me a lot of experience using different statistical techniques and tests. I also have extensive knowledge with SAS, Microsoft Excel and particularly R.  
  
## My Objectives

I hope to acquire more on the job experience using different statistical techniques. I am particularly looking for an internship/research opportunity that will help me deepen my understanding and knowledge on how statistics are used to improve the day to day work of a business. If possible, I would love to acquire more experience with data visualizations as I really enjoy work with those.
